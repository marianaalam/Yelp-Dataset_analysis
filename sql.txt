Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. 
For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer.
 You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers
 and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any 
Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. 
If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.

Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10,000 
ii. Business table = 10,000 
iii. Category table = 10,000 
iv. Checkin table = 10,000 
v. elite_years table = 10,000 
vi. friend table = 10,000 
vii. hours table = 10,000 
viii. photo table = 10,000 
ix. review table = 10,000 
x. tip table = 10,000
xi. user table = 10,000 


	SQL code used to arrive at answer:


SELECT
	COUNT(*)
FROM
	TABLE_NAME


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, 
please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = ID -> 10000
ii. Hours = business_id ->  1562
iii. Category = business_id -> 2643
iv. Attribute = business_id  -> 1115
v. Review = id -> 10000
vi. Checkin = business_id -> 493
vii. Photo = id -> 10000 ,business_id -> 6493
viii. Tip = business_id 3979, user_id 537
ix. User = id 10000
x. Friend = user_id 11
xi. Elite_years = user_id 2780

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer:No

	
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

SELECT 
	*
FROM 
	user          
WHERE
	id IS NULL
	OR name IS NULL
	OR review_count IS NULL
	OR yelping_since IS NULL
	OR useful IS NULL

8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:

No, there is no correlation between posting more reviews and having more fans. 
This can be observed by comparing Amy, who has the highest number of fans with 503, but only 609 reviews, and Gerald, who has 253 fans but 2000 reviews. 
Therefore, there is no significant correlation between the number of reviews and the number of fans.

city i picked is : Toronto         
                  
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
yes , one of the 4-5 stars opens at 18:00 which is may be differnt than other others between 10:00 to 11:00  

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
   yes , the 99 Cent Sushi | Restaurant is only 35 reviews which have only 2.0 star rating
 that  means when star raiting is small people dosen't really go an review the reasturant 
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
<img src="1.jpg" width="942" height="501" border="0" alt="" />
Yes the restaurant is 2-3 raiting very close to each other so the problem may be with this location
 but it needs further analysis to confirm that

2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. 
What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? 
List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
         the closed restaurant has much less star raiting than open ones
         
ii. Difference 2:
         
         the closed restaurant has much less total_review than open ones

3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset
 and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them,
 predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started,
 so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
         finding the top states which have the top raiting of business on the top 3 category. 
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
       To conduct the analysis of finding the top states with the highest-rated businesses in the top 3 categories,
       two primary types of data are needed: information from the "Business" table and data from the "Category" table. 

    1. **Business Table**: This data should include details about businesses, such as their state, star ratings,
       and potentially additional attributes like business names and reviews. State information is crucial for identifying the states with the highest-rated businesses,
       while star ratings are needed for calculating average ratings per state.
   
    2.**Category Table**: Data from this table is necessary to define and identify the top 3 categories. By connecting categories from this table with businesses 
        in the "Business" table, we can filter and analyze businesses within these specific categories, focusing our analysis on the top-rated ones.

These data choices are strategic, enabling us to pinpoint high-performing businesses in particular states and categories. 
Clean and well-organized data is essential to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the analysis results.
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
